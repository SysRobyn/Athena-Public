# /vibe — Vibe Coding Mode

> **Latency Profile**: VARIABLE  
> **Philosophy**: Speed > Perfection. Ship at 70%.

---

## Activation

When `/vibe` is invoked:

1. **Mode Switch**: Prioritize speed over polish
2. **70% Rule**: Ship when 70% confident, iterate based on feedback
3. **No Overengineering**: Simplest solution that works

---

## Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Prototype in hours, not days |
| **Iteration** | Ship → Feedback → Improve |
| **Pragmatism** | Working > Perfect |
| **Bias to Action** | Do, then refine |

---

## Exit

Return to normal mode with `/think` or next user request.
