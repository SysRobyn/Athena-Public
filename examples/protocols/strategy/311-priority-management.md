# Protocol 311: Priority Management (EV & Marshall Matrix)

> **Source**: Taylor Pearson, "Priority Management"
> **Purpose**: Resolving the "Crisis of Choice" by mathematically and statefully prioritizing high-leverage work.
> **Type**: Strategic Planning / Personal Operations

---

## 1. The Priority Management Pillar

Priority Management is the third pillar of Personal Operations, bridging **Task Management** (Knowing what's on the plate) and **Knowledge Management** (Organizing resources). Without it, systems like GTD or Second Brain fail due to choice paralysis.

---

## 2. The Expected Value (EV) Goal Calculation

For 90-day goals, use the EV formula to override emotional bias and "Shiny Object Syndrome":

**Expected Value = Resources Required x Return on Investment x Probability of Success**

- **Resources**: Time + Cash required (lower is better for EV, but ROI usually scales with investment).
- **Probability**: Linear likelihood of success + **Excitement Level**. Excitement is an evolved proxy for "Interestingness" which leads to breakthroughs.
- **ROI**: Balance between 1-Year ROI (Sustainability/Cashflow) and 5-Year ROI (Compounding/Mastery).

## 3. The Marshall Matrix ($/Hour Value)

Mapped to the 80/20 power law distribution:

| Value Tier | Examples | Athena Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$10,000/hr** | Offer creation, USP, Public Speaking | **Protocol Design / Bionic Architecture** |
| **$1,000/hr** | Sales, Client Management, High-level Copy | **Complex Feature Execution** |
| **$100/hr** | Meetings, Minor updates, Email | **Administrative Sync / Bug Fixes** |
| **$10/hr** | Data entry, Errands, Stats checking | **Not-To-Do List / Automation** |

**The Pareto Delta**: The difference between $1k and $10k work is 10x, not linear. Thinking in these terms enforces ruthless delegation or elimination of $10 tasks.

---

## 4. Energy-Level Scheduling (The Chronotype Buffer)

- **Maker Time (Rocks)**: Focused chunks (3+ hours) for $10k/$1k work (Writing, Coding, Planning).
- **Manager Time (Pebbles)**: Interstitial chunks (30-60 mins) for $100 work (Meetings, Email, Response).
- **Admin Time (Sand)**: "Brain-dead" slots for $10 work (Shopping, Booking, Bills).

---

## 5. The Mason Jar Algorithm (Scheduling Order)

To prevent the "Sand" (Admin) from filling your life, schedule in this exact priority order:

1. **Rest/Social**: Prevents burnout cycles.
2. **Exercise**: Sustains the physiological OS.
3. **Maker Work ($1k-$10k)**: Moves the needle.
4. **Learning**: Primes the future value.
5. **Manager/Admin Work**: Keeps things afloat.
